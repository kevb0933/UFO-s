# UFOs Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose
Dana is a data journalist who wants to create a webpage showing results of different UFO sightings. JavaScript and Bootstrap CSS will be used to create a webpage and dynamic table to visualize the UFO data and create filters to organize information by date, city, state, country, and also shape. 

## Results

### Search
To search using the filter box, input the date you would like to search as well as the city, state, country, and shape of object. This will narrow the search through the UFO dataset.

What will be shown should look something like this.

## Summary 

The main drawback to this website would be that the user would be required to know all the different pieces of info aka: city, date, etc. This could be an easy task for some but if the user were to be unfamiliar with all the information needed, then they would not recieve a narrowed result if any at all.

If the filtering process would have a section to filter by a range of years instead of just one specific date, then this would give the user a larger range of information.
